# 🏫 Class Scheduler Web Application

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Class Scheduling System** is designed for a **university registrar** to automate and optimize class schedules while ensuring no conflicts in teacher assignments, subject hours, room availability, and predefined break periods.

## ✨ Features
- ✅ **Automated Schedule Generation** – Ensures teachers, subjects, and rooms are assigned without conflicts.
- 🕒 **Time Slot Management** – Allocates periods efficiently within **8:00 AM - 5:00 PM**.
- 🔍 **Constraint Handling**:
  - 📚 Teachers are assigned subjects based on specialization.
  - 🎓 Advisory teachers remain with their assigned sections.
  - 🍽️ Homeroom, recess, and lunch breaks are scheduled correctly.
  - ⚖️ Subjects are evenly distributed among teachers.
- 📤 **Data Export & Filtering** – Export schedules to **Excel** and filter by teacher, section, or room.
- 🏢 **Dynamic Room Assignment** – Ensures room availability while considering student capacity.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 🐍 **Backend**: Python
- 🗄️ **Database**: MySQL (PhpMyAdmin)
- 🎨 **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (if applicable)
- 📊 **Data Manipulation**: CSV/Excel

## 🚦 Hard Constraints (Must Be Satisfied)
1. ❌ **No Teacher Conflicts** – A teacher cannot be scheduled to teach multiple subjects at the same time.
2. ❌ **No Room Conflicts** – A room can only have one class at a time.
3. ❌ **No Student Group Conflicts** – A student group can only attend one subject at a time.
4. 🏢 **Correct Room Type** – Laboratory subjects must be assigned to laboratory rooms. Lecture subjects can be in any room.
5. ⏳ **Part-Time Teacher Restriction** – Part-time teachers can only teach on **Saturdays**.
6. 🕘 **School Hours Restriction** – Classes must be scheduled between **8:00 AM and 5:00 PM**.
7. 🍽️ **Lunch Break Restriction** – No classes between **12:00 PM and 1:00 PM**.
8. 🎓 **Course-Year Level Match** – A student group must take only subjects that match their course and year level.
9. 🏫 **Teacher Subject Specialization** – Teachers can only teach subjects they are assigned to.
10. 📅 **Required Weekly Lecture Hours** – Each subject has a required number of lecture hours per week.
11. 🔗 **Continuous Lesson Slots** – Subjects requiring multiple hours should have continuous time slots where possible.
12. ⚠️ **All Subjects Must Be Scheduled** – If a subject cannot be scheduled, it is flagged as **"unassigned"** and reported.

## 🎯 Soft Constraints (Preferable but Can Be Violated)
1. 📊 **Balanced Schedule Distribution** – Avoid scheduling all hours of a subject on the same day. Spread subjects across multiple days where possible.
2. 🗓️ **Evenly Distribute Classes Across Days** – Prioritize underutilized days (e.g., **Tuesday and Wednesday**) over heavily scheduled ones (e.g., **Monday and Friday**).
3. 🏫 **Teacher Room Stability** – Teachers prefer to teach in the same room whenever possible.
4. ⏳ **Teacher Time Efficiency** – Teachers prefer sequential lessons with minimal gaps between their classes.
5. 📚 **Student Group Subject Variety** – Avoid scheduling the same subject multiple times in a row to increase variety in student learning.
6. 🕰️ **Minimize Teacher Gaps** – Reduce the number of free periods between a teacher’s lessons.
